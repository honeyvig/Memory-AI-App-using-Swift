# Memory-AI-App-using-Swift
Experienced IOS Swift Developer that worked with Voice & Vision AI Models and can build apps.

We are building an app for students to memorize notes.

The student will be able to make a photo from notes or ask for a topic to learn and then our AI will hold conversations and ask questions with follow ups until the student can break down complex topics into simple, digestible explanations and remember them.

You task will be:
- build and fine-tune the Voice AI (question & voice)
- implementing vision to process the photo
- developing the front-end and backend for the app
(based on figma designs and our conversations)
- managing the GitHub and Appstore deployment.
- fixing bugs (if any, once the app is live)
---------------
To develop an app that uses both Voice AI and Vision AI to help students memorize notes through photos and voice conversations, the project will involve several critical steps in iOS Swift development. Below is an outline of the key areas involved in developing the app, as well as some Python code snippets to handle AI-related tasks (voice and vision).
Steps for Building the iOS App
1. Voice AI Implementation (Question & Voice Interaction)

You will need to integrate Speech Recognition, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Text-to-Speech (TTS) functionalities in the app to facilitate conversations.
Swift Code for Voice Interaction (Speech Recognition)

Use the Speech framework to implement speech-to-text functionality. Additionally, integrate NLP to ask questions and analyze the responses.

import Speech
import AVFoundation

class VoiceAssistant: NSObject, SFSpeechRecognizerDelegate {

    private let speechRecognizer = SFSpeechRecognizer(locale: Locale(identifier: "en-US"))
    private var recognitionRequest: SFSpeechAudioBufferRecognitionRequest?
    private var recognitionTask: SFSpeechRecognitionTask?
    private var audioEngine = AVAudioEngine()
    
    // Function to start listening
    func startListening() {
        guard let recognizer = SFSpeechRecognizer(), recognizer.isAvailable else {
            print("Speech recognition not available.")
            return
        }
        
        let request = SFSpeechAudioBufferRecognitionRequest()
        recognitionRequest = request
        
        // Setup the audio session
        let inputNode = audioEngine.inputNode
        let recordingFormat = inputNode.outputFormat(forBus: 0)
        
        inputNode.installTap(onBus: 0, bufferSize: 1024, format: recordingFormat) { (buffer, when) in
            request.append(buffer)
        }
        
        audioEngine.prepare()
        
        try? audioEngine.start()
        
        recognitionTask = speechRecognizer.recognitionTask(with: request) { (result, error) in
            if let result = result {
                let spokenText = result.bestTranscription.formattedString
                print("Recognized Text: \(spokenText)")
                
                // Process text with NLP (check for answers, etc.)
                self.processText(spokenText)
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Function to process recognized speech and engage in conversation
    func processText(_ text: String) {
        // This is where NLP can be implemented to analyze the spoken text
        // For example: if the user answers a question incorrectly, the AI can follow up with more questions.
        if text.lowercased().contains("science") {
            print("Let's talk about science!")
            // AI will ask a follow-up question
        }
    }
}

Voice Response (Text-to-Speech)

Use the AVSpeechSynthesizer to respond to the user via voice.

import AVFoundation

func speakText(_ text: String) {
    let synthesizer = AVSpeechSynthesizer()
    let utterance = AVSpeechUtterance(string: text)
    synthesizer.speak(utterance)
}

2. Vision AI to Process the Photo (Optical Character Recognition)

Use Vision framework for processing images and Tesseract OCR for text recognition from photos. You’ll allow users to take a photo of their notes, which the AI will process to extract text.
Swift Code for OCR with Vision Framework

import Vision
import UIKit

class VisionProcessor {
    
    // Function to recognize text from an image
    func recognizeText(from image: UIImage, completion: @escaping (String) -> Void) {
        guard let cgImage = image.cgImage else {
            print("Unable to convert UIImage to CGImage")
            return
        }
        
        let request = VNRecognizeTextRequest { (request, error) in
            guard let observations = request.results as? [VNRecognizedTextObservation], error == nil else {
                print("Failed to recognize text: \(error?.localizedDescription ?? "Unknown error")")
                return
            }
            
            // Collect recognized text from observations
            let recognizedText = observations.compactMap { observation in
                observation.topCandidates(1).first?.string
            }.joined(separator: "\n")
            
            completion(recognizedText)
        }
        
        request.recognitionLevel = .accurate
        
        let requestHandler = VNImageRequestHandler(cgImage: cgImage, options: [:])
        
        do {
            try requestHandler.perform([request])
        } catch {
            print("Failed to perform OCR: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        }
    }
}

This will allow the app to take an image from the user's notes and use OCR to extract the text, which can then be processed further by AI for creating questions or feedback.
3. Backend Development (AI Model & NLP)

You will likely need to implement a backend API to handle machine learning tasks such as question generation, personalized learning, and analyzing user responses.
Flask Example for Backend (Python)

For AI interactions, the backend can use NLP and machine learning models like GPT-3 or BERT to generate follow-up questions and analyze the user's answers.

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import openai

openai.api_key = "your-api-key"

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/ask_question', methods=['POST'])
def ask_question():
    data = request.json
    user_input = data['user_input']
    
    # Using GPT-3 for generating follow-up questions
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=f"Generate a follow-up question based on this input: {user_input}",
        max_tokens=100
    )
    
    question = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    
    return jsonify({"question": question})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

This backend will receive the student's input, analyze it using GPT-3, and send a follow-up question back to the iOS app.
4. Frontend Development (iOS UI)

The front-end should allow students to interact with the app smoothly. Based on your Figma designs, you can use SwiftUI for creating a clean and responsive UI.

Here’s an example of a basic UI for the app that will handle interactions:

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var userInput: String = ""
    @State private var aiResponse: String = "Ask me anything!"

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            TextField("Type your question", text: $userInput)
                .padding()
                .textFieldStyle(RoundedBorderTextFieldStyle())
            
            Button(action: {
                // Call backend API to get a response
                getAIResponse(userInput: userInput)
            }) {
                Text("Ask AI")
                    .font(.title)
                    .padding()
            }
            
            Text(aiResponse)
                .padding()
                .font(.title2)
                .multilineTextAlignment(.center)
        }
        .padding()
    }
    
    func getAIResponse(userInput: String) {
        // Call the backend API to get a response (this can be done using URLSession)
        let url = URL(string: "http://your-backend-api/ask_question")!
        var request = URLRequest(url: url)
        request.httpMethod = "POST"
        request.setValue("application/json", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Type")
        
        let body: [String: Any] = ["user_input": userInput]
        request.httpBody = try? JSONSerialization.data(withJSONObject: body)
        
        URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: request) { data, response, error in
            if let data = data, let jsonResponse = try? JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data) as? [String: Any],
               let question = jsonResponse["question"] as? String {
                DispatchQueue.main.async {
                    aiResponse = question
                }
            }
        }.resume()
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}

5. GitHub and App Store Deployment

Managing GitHub: You should use GitHub for version control, and establish best practices for branching (e.g., dev for development, main for production).

App Store Deployment:

    Create an App Store developer account.
    Make sure the app complies with Apple’s App Store guidelines (e.g., privacy policies, AI usage).
    Use Xcode to manage builds and deploy to the App Store.

Conclusion

This system integrates Voice AI (via Speech Framework), Vision AI (via Vision & OCR), and NLP-powered conversation models (via GPT-3 or similar AI systems). The front-end is built using SwiftUI and the back-end uses Flask to process data. With a solid testing process and deployment pipeline, you can achieve a production-ready app within the timeline.
